# Ukraine History Simulator Documentation

This is the official documentation repository for the [:octocat: `Ukraine History Simulator historical video game project`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Ukraine-History-Simulator/)

## Timeline

### Pre-historic Ukraine

This game plans to support the pre-historical era of Ukraines history, all the way down to 32000 BCE and below.

### Early Ukraine

This game plans to support the early historical era of Ukraines history.

### Medieval Ukraine

This game plans to support the medieval era of Ukraines history.

### Early Modern Ukraine (?-1919)

This game plans to support the early modern era of Ukraines history, from the end of Medieval Ukraine, to the USSR era.

### Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (1919-1991)

This game plans to document the Soviet Union era of Ukraines history, including the Nazi occupation in the 1940s. Soviet symbols are fine at a certain level, but for legal and ethical reasons, media from the Nazi era is not allowed in full (such as adorning Nazi Swastikas or other hate symbols) modifications can be made to the game, but the main distribution currently has no plans for Nazi mods. If you are to do this, you should continue at your own risk, remember there are legal risks of doing this in Germany, Austria, Belgium, and several other European countries.

### Early Modern Ukraine (1991-2014)

This game plans to document the early modern period of Ukraine, from the declaration of independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 to the [Russo-Ukrainian war in 2014](#Russo-Ukrainian-war--2014-present-).

### Russo-Ukrainian war (2014-present)

In 2014, February and 2014, March, Russia illegally annexed the Crimean Peninsula of Ukraine and ignited the Russo-Ukrainian war, which intensified following [the 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine](#2022-Russian-invasion-of-Ukraine--2022-present-)

Due to the fog of war, data from 2016 and onward currently cannot be represented in the game.

#### 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine (2022-present)

On 2022, February 24th, Russia launched a massive invasion of Ukraine, making false claims of Nazism, persecution, and also advocated the genocide of Ukrainians. The war is ongoing (as of writing this, on 2023, Friday, January 27th) with significant destruction of life and property. The people of Ukraine are highly resistant to Russias invasion, and have continued to defy the illegal annexation and occupation of their homeland. Slava Ukraini! Heroyam Slava! (Слава Україні! геро́ям сла́ва!)

Due to the fog of war (and a lack of data because of this) the game does not plan to have detailed support for current phases of the war, although support is planned for this in the future.

## Simulator or emulator?

Is this game a simulator or an emulator? It is currently up for debate.
